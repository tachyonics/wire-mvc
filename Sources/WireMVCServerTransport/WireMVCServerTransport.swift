// Serve proposal-native WireMVC controllers on OpenAPIRuntime's `ServerTransport` (Hummingbird/Vapor
// via swift-openapi-hummingbird/-vapor). The bridge adapts the proposal's `~Copyable` streaming
// reader/sender that `@Controller`'s witnesses drive down to the transport's copyable `HTTPBody`
// currency. It's a thin per-route adapter: `ServerTransport` does its own routing and supplies the
// path parameters, so there's no router here — one `transport.register` per collated route.
//
// The response bridge **streams**: a raw handler (M5.2 — SSE, chunked bodies) drives the sender
// incrementally, and each write flows to the transport's `HTTPBody` through a rendezvous `AsyncChannel`
// (backpressure), so an unbounded stream never buffers. Typed handlers take a one-shot `sendAndFinish`
// fast path that keeps a known-length body (`Content-Length`, not chunked). Proven end-to-end in
// swift-wire-spikes/spike-14.
//
// A `ServerTransport` handler must outlive the `register` closure (it produces the streamed body the
// framework consumes afterward), so it runs in a task that can't be a structured child. For a streamed
// response that task's lifetime is bound to the returned body — released (and cancelled) when the
// transport is done with or drops the body — so a client disconnect doesn't leak a handler parked on
// backpressure.
//
// The bridge types are ordinary *copyable* structs: `AsyncReader`/`HTTPResponseSender`/
// `CallerAsyncWriter` are `~Copyable`/`~Escapable`, but that relaxes the constraint (conformers may be
// non-copyable), it doesn't require it.
