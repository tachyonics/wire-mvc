// bindings are `@propertyWrapper`s in RequestBinding.swift).

/// — into `WireMVCKeys.routeContributors`, not the controller itself. swift-wire's contributor-proxy
/// synthesis constructs the proxy (depending on the controller plus any factories its `@Middleware(key)`
/// use-sites demand) and collates that. So a controller needs only `@Singleton @Controller` and stays a
/// plain, footgun-free binding — the proxy is the only type that holds the lifted factories.
