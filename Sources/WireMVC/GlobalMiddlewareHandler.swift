/// The global-middleware **front layer** (M5.5 Phase 5). The `@WireMVCBootstrap` composition root's
/// `@Middleware` wraps *every* request — matched routes and the `@NotFound` fallback alike — by wrapping
/// the finalized router in this handler once, in the generated `@main`. It folds a composed non-transforming
/// global chain around the inner handler's `handle`, so global concerns (access logging, auth gates, CORS)
/// run outside the router without being replicated into each route's codegen.
///
/// The terminal calls `inner.handle`, which is fixed on the router's box type and demands `consuming
/// sending` reader/sender. That is why global middleware must be **non-transforming** (`Chain.Input ==
/// Chain.NextInput` — the box type is preserved end-to-end): they observe and short-circuit-by-writing, but
/// cannot transform the context/reader/sender the router expects. Transforming middleware stay
/// controller/route-scope, where the generated terminal is shaped for the transformed box. The reader/sender
/// survive the box fold as `sending` because ``RequestResponseMiddlewareBox`` holds them in
/// ``WireDisconnected`` — the property that lets this terminal reach `inner.handle` at all.
///
/// `Chain` is the concrete composed middleware (`wireCompose`'s inferred type), taken as a generic parameter
/// so it needn't be named (`Middleware` has two primary associated types, so `some Middleware<Input>` with a
/// pinned input is not expressible).
