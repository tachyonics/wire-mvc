// A request-scoped controller — the M5.4 case. `@Scoped(seed: HTTPRequest.self) @Controller` makes the
// controller a *bridge* proxy: it's constructed fresh per request from the request seed (via the
// plugin-generated `_wireEnterScope` thunk), injecting a request-scoped `RequestInfo` built from that
// same seed, alongside the app-`@Singleton` `UserStore` (shared across every request).

/// A request-scoped value built from the `HTTPRequest` seed — its `path` reflects the request that
/// opened the scope, so two requests see two different instances. Its `@Inject init` is **async** and
/// awaits the borrowed app-`@Singleton` `UserStore`, so the example verifies swift-wire constructs a
/// request-scoped binding through an `async` init (the scope-entry thunk emitting `await`), not only a
/// synchronous one — the path the sessions example sidestepped by deferring its async read to a handler.
